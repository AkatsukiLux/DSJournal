If there was a function in the Office 365 suite that can be described as the 'God function' it would have to be the Get Data function!

## The Problem: Data Silos

Spurious unlinked data sets of outdated and unmaintained data is all far too common place within businesses. When the management team want insights, it is one thing getting an overall view of information but very quickly they want to start asking the 5 whys and delve into the cause of an issue and how to unblock it. Many projects are complex, and the only way to glean these insights is through connected data.

## The Solution: Get Data

The 'God function' gives this power to the masses. The perils of having to understand the intricacies of the HTTP protocol are less pertinent. The Get Data function allows us to connect up to 70 different data management systems as easily as just signing in. Pulling the data straight into Excel, everyone's go-to analysis tool for solving the world's problems!

And even better still, it has been announced, in November time you will be able to write custom connectors! Branching out the possibilities of connected data even further!
